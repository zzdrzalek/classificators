# classificators
The analysis was carried out in order to present different types of classifications f.ex: Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc. 
The main goal was to find the best match to data. Dataset contains data about apartments, that are rented via Airbnb in Kopenhag. 
For calculations and manipulations I used python libriaries like pandas, sklearn, matplotlib and seaborn.
